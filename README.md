# Monte-Carlo-Estimator
This is a python program that enables you to estimate any area from an imported image or a drawing (that you draw yourself)

#How it works
You can estimate either a drawed area from scratch or an area from an external file
If you want to import an area from a map you can use this: https://snazzymaps.com/style/24088/map-without-labels (screenshot a map part containing the area you're interested at)
You'll have to set colors to be used as "in the area", this means that when a random pixel has one of these colors we consider the pixel as in the area
To end with, you'll must to set a graduation that will be used to scale the result
